# java-to-graphviz

**java-to-graphviz** takes your java source code and converts it into graphviz diagrams.

This is the sort of thing you might want to do when you take a look at some piece of code and realise it's a completely 
unmaintainable mess but it still needs to be documented somehow.

Anyway. You can annotate the generated diagram using specially-formatted comments, because I think annotations
are an abomination. You can probably use annotations as well later on once I've implemented that.

So anyway here's the type of output it can produce:

|  AST node |  Sample code | Diagram |

[//]: # (The markdown source for this table is an abomination. I blame github.)

and this is what it looks like when you throw that all together:


![](http://gitlab.dev.randomnoun/randomnoun/java-to-graphviz/raw/master/src/site/readme/example-complicated.png)

You obviously won't want that, so it suppresses nodes by default, to give you just the nodes you're interested in.

![](http://gitlab.dev.randomnoun/randomnoun/java-to-graphviz/raw/master/src/site/readme/example-simple.png)

Here's a maven plugin to generate these things during your build process. Include them in your javadoc via

    /** Something like this <img src="the-diagram.png"/> */
    
Here's another plugin which colours in the nodes using jacoco output.

Here's another eclipse plugin which hooks in via JVMTI to do that in realtime.

Here's another plugin which annotates the nodes with generated bytecodes.

Here's another plugin which adds in AOP nodes.

And so on.

# Processing

Theres' a few different stages in the pipeline.

1. **Parse source file into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. 
This uses [the eclipse parser](https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/+/master/org.eclipse.jdt.core/dom/org/eclipse/jdt/core/dom/ASTParser.java), so should be able to handle the newer java language features, such as lambdas and inner classes. I'm aware inner classes were added back in the java 1.2 era so probably isn't considered a new language feature any more.

2. **Extract comments**. For reasons of efficiency, the eclipse parser doesn't store comments in the AST tree where the comments actually appear, they're in a separate list.
We scan this list for "gv" comments, and try to attribute the comment to the AST node it refers to.

3. **Generate Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. This will store our graphviz representation of the AST, and initially looks very similar to the AST, with some additional metadata.
Note it's not strictly a DAG, as we can get loops due to for/while/do constructs, but any edges leading backwards are marked as 'back' edges so we can still treat it as a DAG later by ignoring these edges.

4. **Generate edges**. This recurses through the DAG and adds control flow edges to it. This may involve 'rejigging' the DAG so that nodes that execute before others are located before them in the diagram.

5. **Filter nodes**. This recurses through the DAG and removes unnecessary nodes; e.g. "A -> B -> C" segments can be reduced to "A -> C". The filtering occurs around 'keepNodes' which must be kept in the final diagram. Users can control how nodes are filtered and kept using special "gv" comments in the source code.

6. **Create DOM**. The filtered DAG is converted into a HTML-like document object model (DOM). This represents the DAG structure in terms of "graph", "node" and "edge" elements, with attributes for user-supplied styles and labels, also supplied using special "gv" comments.

7. **Apply styles**. The DOM has a CSS stylesheet applied to it. JavaToGraphviz comes with a few builtin stylesheets, but you can replace or override these in a number of ways. During this step,
final node and edge IDs, labels, and formatting are determined. Additionally, extra subgraphs can be added into the diagram, which restructures the DOM and adds subgraphs into the DAG.

8. **Extract styles**. The applied styles in the DOM are copied back into the DAG.

9. **Create DOT**. The DAG is converted into graphviz "dot" syntax, which can then be used as input to the graphviz "dot" program to create the final diagram.


# Syntax

The general gist of the thing is that you can add comments inside your source code in order to shape the diagram that's generated.

Those comments start with "gv:" ( or variations on that ) to differentiate them from your normal run-of-the-mill commentary.

The gv directives can be one of the following:

| Syntax |  Example | Description |
|--|--|--|
| // gv: | <pre>// gv: open box</pre> | override the label for a node.<br/>If on it's own line can add additional nodes to the diagram |
| // gv: { css } | <pre>// gv: open box { color: green; shape: oval; }</pre> | override the label for a node, and supply additional formatting.<br/>The formatting is expressed as a CSS rule, but uses [graphviz attribute names](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html) rather than the usual CSS property names |
| // gv#id: | <pre>// gv#openBox: open box </pre> | override the ID for a node.<br/>This can be used to make the graphviz output more understandable, or to apply styles in a separate stylesheet |
| // gv.class: | <pre>// gv#openBox.green.oval: open box </pre> | add CSS classes to a node.<br/>This can be used to make the graphviz output more understandable, or to apply styles in a separate stylesheet. Many classes may be assigned to a node, but only a single ID. Additional classes may be added by other parts of the JavaToGraphviz (e.g. a class representing the node type is added when the DAG is constructed, so that all "if" nodes can later be shaped as diamonds ) |
| // gv-style: { rules } | <pre>/* gv-style: {<br/>  // CSS properties applied to all 'if' nodes<br/>  node.if {<br/>    gv-idFormat: "if_${lineNumber}";<br/>    gv-wordwrap: 20;<br/>    shape : diamond; <br/>  }<br/>  edge.if.true { label: "Y"; }<br/>  edge.if.false { label: "N"; }<br/>} */</pre> | defines CSS style rules.<br/>Most CSS property names correspond to graphviz attribute names, but those beginning with "gv-" are processed within JavaToGraphviz instead. |
| // gv-style: { @import } | <pre>// gv-style: { @import "JavaToGraphviz.css"; }</pre> | import a CSS stylesheet.<br/>Attempts to find the stylesheet in the classpath first, then the local filesystem |
| // gv-keepNode: spec | <pre>// gv-keepNode: expressionStatement block</pre> | Changes the 'keepNode' flags when creating DAG nodes.<br/>If the default keepNode value is true, then individual nodes can be excluded by prefixing them with a minus sign; e.g. <pre>// gv-keepNode: -expressionStatement -block</pre> Also note that any node that has a <pre>// gv: comment</pre> is also kept. |
| // gv-literal: dot | <pre>// gv-literal: { rank = same; case1; case2; }</pre> | Adds graphviz 'dot' code directly into the final graphviz diagram |
| // gv-subgraph | <pre>// gv-subgraph: something noteworthy</pre> | Starts a subgraph in the diagram.<br/>Subgraphs can have borders and other formatting applied, and can be used to highlight different parts of the code. Subgraphs can be nested. |
| // gv-endSubgraph | <pre>// gv-endSubgraph</pre> | Closes a subgraph<br/>You probably want to do this at the same depth in the AST tree; e.g. in the same block that opened the subgraph. |
| // gv-graph | <pre>// gv-graph: something separate</pre> | Starts a new graphviz diagram.<br/>The first time this is encountered, everything before this line is discarded, and this line marks the beginning of a new diagram.<br/>If omitted, the entire class/interface is drawn. |
| // gv-endGraph | <pre>// gv-endGraph</pre> | Closes a graph.<br/>Nodes will not be processed until a new graph is created with gv-graph. |
| // gv-option key=value | <pre>// gv-option: centralSwitch=true</pre> | Options can be used to change how JavaToGraphviz creates nodes and edges |

Here's all that again in a bit more detail.

## Labels

To change the label on the diagram, supply some text after the "gv:", e.g. "gv: order some donuts" would appear as

[ order some donuts ]

## Styles

You can include individual style rules on the "gv:" comment by putting them in curly braces; e.g. "gv: order some donuts { color: blue }" would appear as 

[ order some donuts ]

You can also apply styles to various nodes using the graphviz equivalent of CSS, in which style rules are defined in a "gv-style:" block,
and then you can assign classes and IDs in your gv comments to apply those rules. 

I'm using a real CSS parser here, so all the fiddly bits around specificity should apply to those rules, assuming you know them, 
which you should if you're born any time past the 1990s.

/* gv-style: {
      // some rules 
      .something { color: blue; }
      .special { color: red; }
      #unique { color: green; }
  } 
*/

begin(); // gv: the beginning { fillcolor: something; } 
someCode(); // gv.something: well hello there
someOtherCode(true); // gv.something.special: well hello there again
someOtherCode(false); // gv#unique: righteo then

## Style DOM

Those styles are applied to a pretend DOM that is created separate from the graphviz diagram; the style rules you create are applied to the imaginary DOM and then the calculated styles are used in the generated diagram.

The DOM looks a little bit like the AST of the program, but different. Here's a snippet before styles are applied.

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;graph&gt;
   &lt;graphNode&gt;&lt;/graphNode&gt;
   &lt;graphEdge&gt;&lt;/graphEdge&gt;
   &lt;node id label classname="ForStatement" class="typeDeclaration class"&gt;
    &lt;node id label class="simpleName"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
    &lt;node id label methodname="testFor" class="methodDeclaration"&gt;
     &lt;node id label class="simpleName"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
     &lt;node id label class="block"&gt;
      &lt;node id label=" start of method" class="comment"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
      &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
      &lt;node id label class="for"&gt;
       &lt;node id label type="int" class="initialiser variableDeclarationExpression"&gt;
        &lt;node id label variablename="i" type="int" class="variableDeclarationFragment"&gt;
         &lt;node id label class="simpleName"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
         &lt;node id label literalvalue="0" class="numberLiteral literal"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
         &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
        &lt;/node&gt;
        &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
       &lt;/node&gt;
       &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
       &lt;node id label operatortoken="&lt;" operatorname="InfixExpression$Operator" class="expression infixExpression"&gt;
        &lt;node id label name="i" class="simpleName"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
        &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
        &lt;node id label literalvalue="12" class="numberLiteral literal"&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
        &lt;edge&gt;&lt;/edge&gt;
       &lt;/node&gt;
</pre>

There are some elements and attributes in that DOM which are created automatically from the Java source, those are:

| Element | Description |
|--|--|
| html, head, body | These HTML elements exist solely so that I can use the jsoup CSS selector code to apply CSS rules to the DOM |
| graph | The `graph` element represents an entire graphviz diagram. Styles applied to this node are set on the graphviz `digraph` |
| graphNode | The `graphNode` element represents the [default node styles](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html). Styles applied to this node are set on a `node` object in the `digraph`. <br/>Note you could also apply styles to all nodes by using a `.node` selector in a CSS rule. There's pros and cons to each approach. |
| graphEdge | The `graphEdge` element represents the [default edge styles](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html). Styles applied to this node are set on an `edge` object in the `digraph`.  <br/>Note you could also apply styles to all edges by using an `.edge` selector in a CSS rule. There's pros and cons to each approach. |
| node | Each `node` represents a node in the DAG, which usually represents a node in the AST. `node`s created from AST nodes will have a class attribute containing the AST type ( e.g. `methodDeclaration` for a [MethodDeclaration](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rational-soft-arch/9.5?topic=SS8PJ7_9.5.0/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/dom/MethodDeclaration.html) ) |
| edge | Each `edge` represents an edge in the DAG. Edges may have other classes assigned by the specific Edger implementation ( e.g. the ControlFlowEdger will add 'true' and 'false' classes to edges leading out of 'if' nodes ) |

There are a few standard attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|--|--|
| id | Each node has an id attribute which can be used to select that node from external CSS. If blank, it will be set using `gv-idFormat` rules in the CSS |
| label | Each node has a label attribute which populates the graphviz 'label' attribute. If blank, it will be set using `gv-labelFormat` rules in the CSS |
| class | Each node and edge may have additional classes defined by the Edger or by the user in gv comments |
| style | Each node and edge may have additional styles defined by the user in gv comments |
| lineNumber | The starting line number of this node in the source code. As these line numbers are used to generate default IDs, they are suffixed with an incrementing integer to allow multiple nodes on the same source line. |


And some attributes added to nodes by the ControlFlowEdger:

| Attribute | Applies to | Description |
|--|--|--|
| className | classSomething | The name of the Java class or interface |
| methodName | methodDeclaration | The name of the method |
| name |  | The name of the variable, usually |
| exceptionSpec |  | The type and name of the caught exception |
| operatorToken |  | The operatorToken ( e.g. "*" ) |
| operatorName |  | a more css-friendly version of the operator token ( e.g. "operatorAsterisk" ) | 
| type |  | The type of the variable |
| variableName |  | The name of the variable |
| literalValue |  | The literal value in the source code |
| fieldName |  | The name of the field |

And attributes added to edges by the ControlFlowEdger:

| Attribute | Applies to | Description |
|--|--|--|
| breakLabel | Break | if a target label was included in the `break`, that target label, otherwise an empty string  |
| continueLabel |  if a target label was included in the `continue`, that target label, otherwise an empty string  |

The AST classes you're going to get in your DOM are:

[ big list of those ]

Users can create CSS rules based on the values of these elements and attributes, which are then applied to the DOM and merged with the a 'style' attribute.

## Style properties

Most properties correspond to graphviz attributes; see the [Graphviz documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html) for a complete list of these.

Some additional properties are handled by JavaToGraphviz itself, these are all namespaced with a "gv-" prefix.

Prefixed properties inculde

| Property |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| gv-idFormat | The `gv-idFormat` is used to assign IDs to nodes. These IDs are visible in the DOM, and in the generated graphviz diagram. <br/>Other attributes can be included in the idFormat by specifying their name in curly brackets, <br/>The default `gv-idFormat` specified in `JavaToGraphviz-base.css` is <pre>node {<br/>  gv-idFormat: "s_${lineNumber}";<br/>}</pre> which assigns an ID of `"s_"` followed by the line numebr of the node. <br/>As these `${lineNumber}`s are used to generate default IDs, they are suffixed with an incrementing integer to allow multiple nodes on the same source line. |
| gv-labelFormat | The `gv-labelFormat` is used to assign labels to nodes. These IDs are visible in the DOM, and in the generated graphviz diagram.
<br/>Other attributes can be included in the idFormat by specifying their name in curly brackets, similar to the gv-idFormat.
<br/>The labelFormat may include the id, or the id may include the label, but they may not include each other.
| gv-wordwrap | The `gv-wordWrap` property can be used to force newlines to be added into the node label. 
This is useful for some graphviz shape types ( e.g. diamond ), which become overly stretched if their label is wide.
| gv-newSubgraph | Create a new subgraph 'underneath' the selected element |
| gv-beginOuterSubgraph | Create a new subgraph 'above' the selected element, then move the selected element and all nodes to gv-endSubgraph into that subgraph |
| gv-endOuterSubgraph | Marks the end of the subgraph created by `gv-beginOuterSubgraph`. |
| gv-truncateEdges | Either "incoming", "outgoing", "none" or "both". Will truncate the edges leading into or out of a subgraph. Must be applied to the same element that had the gv-newSubgraph property. Edges will begin/end outside the subgraph boundary |
| gv-truncateEdges | Either "incoming", "outgoing", "none" or "both". Will truncate the edges leading into or out of a subgraph. Must be applied to the same element that had the gv-newSubgraph property. Edges will begin/end outside the subgraph boundary |
| gv-xlabelFormat | Similar to `gv-labelFormat` but sets the [`xlabel`](https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/xlabel/) attribute, which causes the label to be ignored during graphviz edge routing |

Note that gv-newSubgraph style property ( defined in the CSS ) is not the same as the gv-subgraph directive ( defined in the source code ), discussed earlier, although they perform similar tasks.

## Style examples

This combination of elements, attributes and properties means you can turn all your 'if' statements to diamonds via:

/* gv-style: { .if { shape: diamond; } } */

You can create multiple graphs per source file, and multiple subgraphs per graph, by using some special CSS rules which affect the DOM. 

So you could put all your try/catch statements in subgraphs via

/* gv-style: { .try { something; } } */

Or a subgraph around a particularly exciting bit of code via

// that

CSS doesn't normally do this ( if you ignore ::content pseudo-elements ), so in order to be able to style the DOM elements that are created by these CSS rules,
there are multiple passes of the CSS. 



# Features

DONE
* style rules
* external style refs (classpath, TODO urls, files)
* label formats
* css-defined subgraphs
* comment-defined subgraphs
* a single .java source file can contain multiple graphs and subgraphs
* can put literal gv into the diagram
* few builtin methods/style properties/declarations to make this a bit easier to generate diagrams; e.g. wordwrap, flip logic on if edge labels, probably others
* comment attribution 
* bit of flexibility when it comes to how the diagram is generated ( node suppression , artificial nodes, that sort of thing )
* seeing I"m going to the trouble of creating a DOM to apply styles maybe dump that as well, &/or the AST tree. apply styles to AST nodes vs dag nodes ?
* lambdas, fluent methods, anonymous classes

TODO

So a few things I want to be able to support

* bunch up the exit nodes if there's lots of them
